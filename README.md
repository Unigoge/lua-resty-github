lua-resty-github - Lua library for using the github api


Status
======

This library is still under early development and not functional.

Description
===========

This Lua library is a github utility for the ngx_lua nginx module:

Installation
============

If you are using your own nginx + ngx_lua build, then you need to configure the lua_package_path directive to add the path of your lua-resty-github source tree to ngx_lua's LUA_PATH search path, as in

```nginx
    # nginx.conf
    http {
        lua_package_path "/path/to/lua-resty-github/lib/?.lua;;";
        ...
    }
```

Ensure that the system account running your Nginx ''worker'' proceses have
enough permission to read the `.lua` file.
